## TLDR:
- Excellence is nothing special - it's simply amalgamation of a bunch of tiny techniques, skills, and activities:
    - Each thing moves the needle only a tiny bit, and seems insignificant in isolation
    - However, all of the little things compound and add up, to eventually produce excellence
- Each small thing must be perfected
    - Requires consistent practice
    - The practice is quite mundane - nothing special about it
- The key is to learn what these tiny things are, and learn the proper technique

## Intro
An individual sport like swimming, track, etc. can help us **objectively** compare different athletes.

i.e. we can definitively say that athlete A is better than athlete B, using an objective metric (race times).

> Within competitive swimming in particular, clear stratification exists not only between individuals but also between defined levels of the sport as well.

> By "excellence" I mean "consistent superiority of performance." The excellent athlete regularly, even routinely, performs better than his or her competitors. Consistency of superior performances tells us that one athlete is indeed better than another, that the difference between them is not merely the product of chance.

> By this definition, we need not judge performance against an absolute criterion, but only against other performances.

> To introduce what are sources of excellence for Olympic athletes, I should first suggest - saving the demonstration for later - what does not produce excellence.
>
> (1) Excellence is not, I find, the product of socially deviant personalities. These swimmers
> don’t appear to be “oddballs,” nor are they loners
> (“kids who have given up the normal teenage
> life”). If their achievements result from a personality characteristic, that characteristic is not
> obvious. Perhaps it is true, as the mythology of
> sports has it, that the best athletes are more selfconfident (although that is debatable); but such
> confidence could be an effect of achievement,
> not the cause of it.
>
> (2) Excellence does not result from quantitative changes in behavior. Increased training time,
> per se, does not make one swim fast; nor does increased “psyching up,” nor does moving the arms
> faster. Simply doing more of the same will not
> lead to moving up a level in the sport.
>
> (3) Excellence does not result from some special inner quality of the athlete. “Talent” is one
> common name for this quality; sometimes we
> talk of a “gift,” or of “natural ability.” These terms
> are generally used to mystify the essentially mundane processes of achievement in sports, keeping

> own outcomes.

## I. Excellence Requires Qualitative Differentiation
**Quantitative Change** - keeping the same approach, but increasing the amount or quantity, e.g.
- Increasing the practice time or distance
- Increasing the number of strokes per minute

**Qualitative Change** - modifying the contents of what is actually done, not simply doing more of it

> Different levels of the sport are qualitatively distinct.
> Olympic champions don’t just do much more of
> the same things that summer-league country club
> swimmers do. They don’t just swim more hours,
> or move their arms faster, or attend more workouts. What makes them faster cannot be quantitatively compared with lower-level swimmers,
> because while there may be quantitative differences—and certainly there are, for instance in the
> number of hours spent in workouts—these are
> not, I think, the decisive factors at all.

Three qualitative difference between various levels of swimmers:
1. **Technique** - strokes, dives, turns are all inherently different
    - Higher levels use more optimized form
2. **Discipline** - strictness with training, diet, sleep, warmups, etc.
3. **Attitude** - they genuinely enjoy doing the hard/mundane things - many ordinary people think that mundane training is boring and feels like a sacrifice - but top achievers actually enjoy the process and it doesn't feel like a sacrifice to them.
    > It is incorrect to believe that top athletes
    > suffer great sacrifices to achieve their goals. Often,
    > they don’t see what they do as sacrificial at all.
    > They like it.


> These qualitative differences are what distinguish levels of the sport. They are very noticeable,
> while the quantitative differences between levels,
> both in training and in competition, may be surprisingly small indeed.

> I am suggesting here that athletes do not reach the top level by a simple process of "working their way up," by accumulating sheer time in the sport; improvements across levels of the sport are not generated through quantitative changes.

> It is not by doing increasing amounts of work that one becomes excellent, but rather by changing the kinds of work.

> athletes move up to the top ranks through *qualitative jumps*: noticeable changes in their techniques, discipline, and attitude, accomplished usually through a change in settings, e.g. joining a new team with a new coach, new friends, etc, who work at a higher level. Without such qualitative jumps, no major improvements (movements through levels) will take place.

> The top swimming coaches in America fall into the same prejudice, attributing success often to "hard work" or "talent." Since they habitually, unreflectively, live at the top level (having spent almost their entire coaching career there), they never see what creates the differences between levels. The fact is, quantitative changes do bring success - but only in very limited, locally visible ways.

> Having seen that "more is better" within local situations, we tend to extrapolate: If I work this hard to get to my level, how hard must Olympic swimmers work? If I sacrifice this much to qualify for the State Championships, how much must they sacrifice? We believe, extrapolating from what we learn about success at our own level, that they must work unbelievably hard, must feel incredible pressure, must sacrifice more and more to become successful.

If you believe that stratification between levels is **continuous**, then the mindset of "hard work equals success" makes sense - however, the author argues that the levels are actually **discrete** rather than continuous. 

> If, as I have suggested, there

> So we should envision not a swimming world,
> but multiple worlds (and changing worlds is a

> The differences are not simply quantifiable steps

> Olympic Games. Goals are varied, participants
> have competing commitments, and techniques
> are jumbled

Each world has different values, goals, patterns of behavior, etc.
- At the lower levels of the sport:
    - The goal is to have a good time
    - Coaches are teenagers employed as life guards
    - Practices are held a few times a week
    - Competition lasts for a few weeks
    - Faster athletes are encouraged to slow down, to not ruin others' fun
- At higher levels of the sport:
    - The goal is to optimize for speed
    - Coaches are in charge, parents are rarely seen on the pool deck
    - Practices are held 6 times a week
    - Swimmers travel thousands of miles to compete
    - The fastest swimmers are objects of respect and praise
- However, their social patterns do not differ - they still enjoy playing cards, gossipping, listening to music, just like the others

> techniques once learned and habitualized don't deteriorate overnight. Quite a few swimmers, years past retirement from the sport, can come out and with a few months' practice do quite well.

> Then too, there seem to be permanent or at least persistent effects of hard training: attitudes of competitiveness and strategies for racing once learned are rarely forgotten.

> All of this (admittedly provocative) argument is to suggest that the swimming world is really several different worlds, and the "top" performers are better seen as different than as better.

## II. Why "Talent" does not lead to Excellence

> Up to now, I have suggested that there are discrete social worlds of competitive swimming, and that an athlete joins those different worlds by adopting the behavior patterns of members.

> I am suggesting that athletic excellence is widely attainable, if usually unsought. Many people - let us say, hundreds of thousands in this country - have the physical wherewithal to belong to the Olympic class.

Three points where talent is inadequate:
1. Factors other than talent explain athletic success more precisely.
    -  For example, for swimming:
        - Geographic location (i.e. SoCal where the sun shines year round)
        - Fairly high family income (allows for travel/fees for meets)
        - Height, weight, body proportions
        - Luck/choice of a good coach
        - Inherited muscle structure
        - Parents who are interested in sports
2. Talent is indistinguishable from its effects
    > One cannot see that talent exists until after its effects become obvious.

    > Kalinowski, like many of us, holds to the belief that there must be this thing inside the athlete which precedes and
    > determines success, only later to be discovered. But the recurring evidence he finds suggests a different interpretation:
    > perhaps there is no such thing as "talent," there is only the outstanding performance itself. He sees success and immediately 
    > infers behind it a cause, a cause *for which he has no evidence other than the success itself*. Here, as elsewhere, talent 
    > (our name for this cause) cannot be measured, or seen ,or felt, in any form other than the success to which it supposedly 
    > gives rise.

    > In Kalinowski's analysis, then - and the lay view is much the same as his - there lies an analytic error of the first degree:
    > the independent and the dependent variables cannot be measured separately.
3. The "amount" of talent needed for athletic success seems to be strikingly low.
    > Perhaps the crucial factor is not natural ability at all, but the whillingness to overcome natural or unnatural disabilities of
    > the sort that most of us face, ranging from minor inconveniences in getting up and going to work, to accidents and injuries,
    > to gross physical impairments.

    > And if the basic level of talent needed, then, seems so low as to be nearly universally available, perhaps the very concept of
    > talent itself - no longer differentiating among performers - is better discarded altogether. It simply doesn't explain the
    > differences in outcomes. Rather than talk about talent and ability, we do better to look at what people actually do that
    > creates outstanding performance.

    > What we call talent is no more than a projected reification of particular things done.

    > Through the notion of talent, we transform particular actions that a human being does into an object possessed, held in trust
    > for the day when it will be revealed for all to see.

    > Since talent can be viewed only indirectly in the effects that it supposedly produces, its very existence is a matter of faith.
    > ... And accepting this faith in talent, I suggest, we relinquish our chance of accurately understanding excellence.

## III. The Mundanity of Excellence
### Excellence is mundane.
> Superlative performance is really a confluence of dozens of small skills or activities, each one learned or stumbled upon, which
> have been carefully drilled into habit and then are fitted together in a synthesized whole.
> There is nothing extraordinary or super-human in any one of those actions; only the fact that they are done consistently and
> correctly, and all together, produce excellence.

Examples of little things:
- Proper techniques for
    - Flip turn
    - Push off the wall
    - Hand placement to minimize air cupped
    - Lifting hands over the water
    - Weight-lifting
    - Diet
    - Wearing the correct racing suits

> Each of those tasks seems small in itself, but each allows the athlete to swim a bit faster.

> And having learned and consistently practiced all of them together, and many mroe besides, the swimmer may compete in the Olympic Games.

> The winning of a gold medal is nothing more than the synthesis of a countless number of such little things - even if some of them
> are done unwittingly or by others, and thus called "luck."

> So the "little things" really do count.

For example, Rowdy Gaines studied the starter's habits, and knew a particular starter would fire the gun fast
- This small head start gave him enough advantage to win

> Looking at such subtleties, we can say that not only are the little things important; in some ways, the little things are the only things.

Mary T. Meagher broke the world record by adjusting two things:
1. Coming on time to all practices
2. Always practicing perfect turns during practice (most people are casual/lazy about this)

> At the lowest levels of competitive swimming, simply showing up for regular practices produces the greatest single speed improvement
> the athlete will ever experience.

> Again, the conclusion: the simple doing of certain small tasks can generate huge results. Excellence is mundane.

### Motivation is mundane, too.
> If, on the other hand, that day-to-day reality is itself fun, rewarding, challenging, if the water is nice and friends are
> supportive, the longer-term goals may well be achieved almost in spite of themselves.

> While many of them were working towards the Olympic Games, they divided the work along the way into achievable steps, no one of
> which was too big. They found their challenges in small things.

> They concentrate on what Karl Weick has called "small wins:" the very definable, minor achievements which can be rather easily done
> but which produce significant effects, not the least of which is the confidence to attempt another such "small win."

Weick:
> A small win is a concrete, complete, implemented outcome of moderate importance. By itself, one small win may seem unimportant.
> A series of wins at small but significant tasks, however, reveals a pattern that may attract allies, deter opponents, and lower
> resistance to subsequent proposals. Small wins are controllable opportunities that produce visible results. (Weick 1984, p. 43).

### In the pursuit of excellence, maintaining mundanity is the key psychological challenge.
The best athletes feel at home during the Olympics - it's just another swim meet.

They do all of the same rituals/habits, so they aren't shocked or paralyzed.

The challenge is to maintain a sense of mundanity while under abnormal conditions.

> The mundanity of excellence is typically unrecognized. I think the reason is fairly simple.
> Usually we see great athletes only after they have
> become great—after the years of learning the
> new methods, gaining the habits of competitiveness and consistency, after becoming comfortable in their world. They have long since perfected the myriad of techniques that together
> constitute excellence. Ignorant of all of the specific steps that have led to the performance and
> to the confidence, we think that somehow excellence sprang full grown from this person, and we
> say he or she “has talent” or “is gifted.” 

> But of course there is no secret; there is only
> the doing of all those little things, each one done
> correctly, time and again, until excellence in every detail becomes a firmly ingrained habit, an
> ordinary part of one’s everyday life.

> The action, in itself, is nothing special; the care and consistency with which it is made is.
