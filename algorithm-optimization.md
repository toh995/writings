Basic Principles:
1. Improve algos O(n!) => O(n)
    - Remove unnecessary work
2. Reduce "n" in O(n)
3. Decide WHEN to perform work (read vs. write-time)
    - Tradeoffs between time and space

Changing the interface, vs. changing the *implementation details* of said interface
- Pagination, JSON:API links, sparse field-sets
- Permissions v1 vs v2
